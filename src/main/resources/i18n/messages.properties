broker.documentation.auto.create.topics.enable=A boolean that controls whether Kafka will automatically create topics when a producer or consumer tries to interact with a topic that doesn't exist. It's often set to false in production for better control.
broker.documentation.default.replication.factor=The default number of replicas for a topic created without an explicit replication factor. A higher number provides better fault tolerance but uses more disk space.
broker.documentation.min.insync.replicas=The minimum number of replicas that must be "in sync" with the leader for a producer's write request to be considered successful. This is a critical setting for data durability.
